# Pygame Pong
The lovable simple idea of hitting a blocky ball across the screen with two paddles comes back with a more "modular" and customizable approach. Created using the wonderful programming language, that is Python (PyGame), the game allows for full customizability via a provided XML file.

## Customizability
Not only can you change the background color or the resolution but you can also...
- Change the frame rate of the game
- Modify paddle color, speed, and sizes
- Change application title, fullscreen, and whether to show mouse or not

and more...
