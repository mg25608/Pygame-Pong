# Pygame Pong
The lovable simple idea of hitting a blocky ball across the screen with two paddles comes back with a more "modular" and customizable approach. Created using the wonderful programming language, that is Python (PyGame), the game allows for full customizability via a provided XML file.

# Customizability
Not only can you change the background color or the resolution but you can also...
- Change the frame rate of the game
- Change the paddle speed
- Change the paddle color
- Change the ball color
- Change the ball speed
and more...
